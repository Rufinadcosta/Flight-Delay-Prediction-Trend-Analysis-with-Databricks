# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction & Trend Analysis with Databricks

## 🚀 Project Overview
This end-to-end project leverages Azure Databricks to build a scalable data pipeline and machine learning model that predicts flight delays. It includes real-time data processing, exploratory trend analysis, model training with MLlib, and automated deployment using GitHub Actions and MLflow.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Azure Databricks** (PySpark, MLlib, Notebooks)
- **Delta Lake** for data versioning and storage
- **MLflow** for model tracking and lifecycle management
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation
- **Python**, **Apache Spark**

## 📌 Key Features
- ✅ Ingests and preprocesses flight + weather datasets  
- ✅ Performs exploratory trend analysis (delay patterns by time, airline, weather)  
- ✅ Trains ML model to predict flight delay likelihood  
- ✅ Logs and registers model using MLflow  
- ✅ Deploys workflow automatically using GitHub Actions and Databricks CLI
